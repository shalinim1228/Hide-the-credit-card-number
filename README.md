This Python code masks all but the last four digits of a credit card number. Here's a brief explanation:

Code Breakdown:
Function Definition:

def cc_number(number): defines a function named cc_number that takes a single argument number, representing the credit card number.
Convert Number to String:

number_str = str(number) converts the credit card number to a string. This is necessary because the operations to mask the digits are easier to perform on a string.
Create the Hidden Part:

hidden_part = '*' * (len(number_str) - 4) creates a string of asterisks (*) that is the same length as the credit card number minus the last four digits.
This effectively "hides" all but the last four digits.
Extract the Visible Part:

visible_part = number_str[-4:] extracts the last four digits of the credit card number. The [-4:] slice notation retrieves the last four characters of the string.
Combine Hidden and Visible Parts:

return hidden_part + visible_part combines the hidden part (asterisks) with the visible part (last four digits) and returns the result.
User Input and Output:

number = int(input("enter the number")) prompts the user to input a credit card number, which is then converted to an integer.
print(cc_number(number)) calls the cc_number() function with the user-provided number and prints the masked credit card number.
